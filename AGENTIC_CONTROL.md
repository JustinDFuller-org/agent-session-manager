# Agentic Control

## Vision

Agent Session Manager should be bidirectional: it drives agent harnesses, and
agents can inspect and drive Agent Session Manager. An agent running in a pane
should be able to understand the current workspace and perform the same
meaningful session-management operations available to a user, while preserving
the app's existing lifecycle, persistence, worktree, focus, notification, and
terminal-purity behavior.

The control surface should be an app capability, not a collection of harness-
specific shell commands. The app remains the authority over tabs, panes,
profiles, worktrees, settings, status lines, and notifications.

## Research conclusion

MCP is the preferred agent-facing protocol. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and
OpenCode all support HTTP-based MCP integrations, and MCP standardizes server
discovery, resources, tools, structured results, and errors.

- [MCP transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports)
- [MCP tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools)
- [Claude Code MCP](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)
- [Cursor MCP](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)
- [Codex MCP](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/extend/mcp)
- [OpenCode MCP](https://dev.opencode.ai/docs/mcp-servers/)

Use one app-owned Streamable HTTP MCP server bound to `127.0.0.1`, rather than
one stdio server per pane. The app can then remain the single authority over
live `@MainActor` state and can issue per-pane credentials. Native XPC is a
possible future integration for other local clients, but the harnesses do not
speak XPC and would still require custom adapters.

The official [Swift MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk)
is the first implementation candidate. The repository uses Swift tools 6.1,
matching the SDK's current manifest requirement. The app source remains in its
existing Swift 5 language mode until its separate concurrency migration is
complete; it is still compiled by the installed Swift 6 toolchain. The control
domain must remain independent of that transport decision.

## Configuration

Agent control is configured like other user-facing behavior.

### Injection policy

Persist an `AgentControlInjectionPolicy` in a new app-settings file with these
user-facing choices:

- `Always`
- `Never`
- `Ask (on by default)`
- `Ask (off by default)`

The default is `Ask (on by default)`. When an ask policy is selected,
`NewPaneSheet` displays an Agent Session Manager control toggle using the
corresponding default. The final terminal command remains only the selected
harness command; Swift prepares any MCP configuration and environment before
the process starts.

Persist the resolved per-pane injection decision with session state. Changing
the global policy affects new, restored, and restarted pane launches. Already-
running harness processes require a restart before their environment can
change.

### Scope policy

Persist an `AgentControlScope` with these choices:

- `Pane` — the injected agent can access only its own pane.
- `Tab` — the injected agent can access all panes in its tab.
- `Global` — the injected agent can access the entire app.

The default is `Global`. Scope is enforced for every read and write request, not
just communicated through tool descriptions. Explicitly persisted `Pane` and
`Tab` scopes remain unchanged; legacy settings without a stored scope resolve to
`Global`.

There is no additional Agent Session Manager confirmation dialog for an
authorized MCP mutation. The injection policy controls whether the server is
available; it is not a per-tool approval mechanism. Harness-native MCP
approval behavior remains independent.

## Expected control surface

Expose reads primarily as MCP resources and changes as narrowly scoped tools.
Use stable IDs for addressing; names are display values only.

### Tabs and panes

- Create, inspect, focus, delete, and reorder tabs.
- Create panes with harness, profile, CLI options, environment values,
  worktree reference, base reference, priority, and control-injection choices.
- Inspect, focus, restart, delete, and reorder panes.
- Require explicit worktree-management and cleanup choices when an existing
  app policy would otherwise display an `ask` dialog.
- Preserve existing setup states, worktree ownership, cleanup behavior,
  notification cleanup, active IDs, and session persistence.

### Profiles and harness settings

- Create, inspect, edit, delete, and reorder profiles.
- Enable or disable harnesses for future pane creation.
- Enable harness options and update their default values.
- Update preset choices and multi-value option choices.
- Validate options against the selected harness catalog.
- Redact profile environment-variable values in read resources.

### Status lines and notifications

- Read status-line configuration and current structured status data for panes.
- Update global and profile-specific status-line configuration.
- List notifications with their tab and pane targets.
- Acknowledge a notification atomically by navigating to its pane and removing
  the notification through the same app path used by the UI.

### Diagnostics and observability

Agents should be able to diagnose the pane or workspace they are operating in
without shelling out to inspect app-support files or asking a human to open a
dashboard. Expose diagnostics as scoped MCP resources and bounded query tools:

- Provide a diagnostic summary with app mode, build identity, Debug Mode state,
  active tab and pane IDs, and the scoped session metadata.
- Provide metadata-aware trace queries over current per-pane JSONL files, with
  pane or tab IDs, time windows, event-name filters, result limits, truncation,
  malformed-record, and legacy-file metadata. Read trace metadata rather than
  deriving identity from sanitized filenames.
- Provide invariant queries with occurrence IDs, invariant IDs, integrations,
  severity, timestamps, and bounded context. Preserve repeated occurrences as
  separate records.
- Provide unified-log queries over the Agent Session Manager process and
  subsystem, filtered by time, category, level, and event name. Normalize logs
  into a bounded, redacted result; never expose terminal content, harness
  output, secrets, environment values, or arbitrary system logs. The app may
  use `OSLogStore` for this read path, with date positions and matching
  predicates as the query primitives.
- Return availability and capture-state metadata when Debug Mode is disabled.
  Unified logs remain available because they are always on; existing trace and
  invariant files remain readable, but no new durable records are captured.
- Diagnostic resource reads accept `limit`, `sinceEpochMs`, and `untilEpochMs`.
  They default to 20 records and cap requests at 50; diagnostic query tools
  retain their separate bounds. Readability describes the valid resource
  response, while `tracesCapturing` and `invariantsCapturing` describe durable
  capture state.

Pane scope may read only records attributable to its source pane. Tab scope may
read records attributable to panes in that tab. Unscoped global records and
cross-pane correlation are Global-scope data; they must not be returned to a
pane- or tab-scoped caller merely because they share a time window. Log
correlation must use safe structured IDs or an app-owned projection, never
parsing private message text.

Expose one narrowly scoped `debug.set_mode` tool for enabling or disabling
Debug Mode. It must persist through the existing debug settings path and reuse
the existing tracing and invariant reconfiguration behavior. Only a Global-
scope token may call it. File deletion, retention changes, path changes, and
diagnostic export are outside this first use-case.

The roadmap should maintain a feature-parity matrix for later capabilities,
including continue-on-restart, focus mode, activity state, PR tracking,
worktree policies, diagnostics, and observability.

## Proposed architecture

### Control service

Add an app-owned control service responsible for:

- Starting the localhost listener before any injected pane can launch.
- MCP initialization, resource discovery, tool discovery, and tool calls.
- One high-entropy bearer token per injected pane.
- Mapping tokens to source pane and configured scope.
- Origin validation, request limits, timeouts, cancellation, and token revocation.
- Structured audit events with secrets and bearer tokens redacted.

Network handlers should validate and decode requests, then dispatch to a
main-actor command router. The router should operate on existing
`AppState`/`AppSettings`/`Tab`/`Pane`/`Profile` behavior rather than duplicating
UI mutations or bypassing existing side effects.

Expose Codable snapshots and operation results instead of observable model
objects. A snapshot should include current IDs, names, harnesses, worktree
metadata, setup/activity state, profiles, option catalogs, status data, and
notifications, subject to the caller's scope.

### Harness adapters

Each adapter must generate app-owned configuration without overwriting user or
repository configuration:

- Claude Code: use its supported MCP configuration mechanism.
- OpenCode: merge an app-owned remote MCP configuration with existing config.
- Codex: use its supported HTTP MCP configuration and bearer-token settings.
- Cursor: resolve the documented project/global configuration limitation and
  provide a per-pane strategy; never overwrite tracked or user-owned
  `.cursor/mcp.json`.

If injection is requested and an adapter cannot prepare valid configuration,
the pane setup must report an actionable error instead of silently claiming
that agent control is active. `Never` or a declined ask choice must leave the
normal pane launch path unaffected.

## Prerequisite: Swift 6 language-mode migration

The Agentic Control implementation is gated on moving the repository to the
latest Swift language mode supported by the active Xcode toolchain. This is a
separate workstream from MCP and must land first so the control surface is not
built on a compatibility mode that we intend to remove.

Plan the migration as its own implementation session:

1. Change the SwiftPM package and generated Xcode targets to Swift 6 language
   mode while retaining the macOS 14 deployment target.
2. Build with the active release Xcode toolchain and inventory all new
   concurrency, isolation, Sendable, and framework-import diagnostics.
3. Migrate production code and tests in focused groups, preserving existing
   actor boundaries and adding explicit isolation or Sendable conformances
   only where they describe the real ownership model.
4. Run the complete unit, format, SwiftLint, Dev UI, and screenshot validation
   suite; separate pre-existing test failures from migration regressions.
5. Record the supported Xcode and Swift versions in the build documentation and
   CI so future toolchain updates remain intentional.

The prerequisite is complete when the package declares Swift 6 language mode,
the app and UI-test targets compile in that mode, all required validation is
green, and no compatibility-only compiler settings remain. Only then should
the MCP implementation roadmap continue with domain configuration and
persistence.

### Ongoing version maintenance

Version updates are automated, but compatibility remains a required gate:

- `Package.swift` owns direct package lower bounds and the Swift tools/language
  mode declaration; `Package.resolved` records the exact dependency graph.
- Dependabot checks Swift packages and GitHub Actions daily, groups compatible
  updates, and may auto-merge only patch and minor dependency updates after
  required CI checks. Major updates remain review-required.
- `dependency-toolchain-compatibility.yml` runs on dependency and toolchain
  changes and weekly. It checks the supported toolchain floor, resolves the
  locked graph, and builds the release package before an update can be
  accepted. Unit tests remain covered by the existing test workflows when
  enabled; the floor build intentionally avoids conflating XCTest SDK
  isolation differences with package compatibility.
- `scripts/check-toolchain.sh` requires Swift 6.1 or newer and Xcode 16 or
  newer, while the current validated local toolchain is recorded as Swift 6.4
  with Xcode 27.0. A toolchain upgrade must update this documentation and
  retain the full compatibility checks.
- Distributed app versions remain derived from release tags and commit count
  by `scripts/dist.sh`; dependency or toolchain updates do not silently change
  the product version.

The maintenance workflow is: accept or review the Dependabot update, inspect
the resolved graph and release notes, run the compatibility workflow, then
update the Swift/Xcode baseline only when the supported toolchain policy
changes. Do not bypass a failed compatibility build with weaker concurrency
checking or an unreviewed dependency pin.

### Domain configuration and persistence record

Roadmap item 2 is implemented as a transport-independent foundation:

- `AgentControlInjectionPolicy` and `AgentControlScope` use stable Codable raw
  values and default to `Ask (on by default)` and `Global`.
- `agent-control-settings.json` stores the app-level policy and scope through
  the existing settings persistence path.
- Pane decisions are persisted in `sessions.json`; legacy panes without the
  field resolve through the current policy and are migrated on the next save.
- Settings and New Pane expose the policy, scope, and per-pane ask decision;
  forced policies expose a read-only state instead of a toggle.
- Dev reset paths clear the new settings file, and UI coverage uses the real
  Settings and New Pane flows.
- Pane-scoped decision telemetry records bounded IDs, policy, scope, source,
  and the resolved enabled value. No listener, token, MCP dependency, or
  harness configuration adapter is introduced in this phase.

### Tab and pane mutations record

Roadmap item 7 is implemented through the app-owned MCP router:

- `tabs.create`, `tabs.delete`, `tabs.focus`, and `tabs.reorder` expose global
  tab lifecycle operations with stable IDs, active-state results, and ordered
  tab IDs.
- `panes.create`, `panes.delete`, `panes.focus`, `panes.restart`, and
  `panes.reorder` use hierarchical pane and tab scope authorization. Pane
  creation awaits existing worktree resolution, duplicate detection, profile
  and option validation, external-worktree management, and launch preparation.
- Profile options and environment values seed pane creation, while explicit
  values override profile values. App-controlled environment variables are
  rejected, runtime environment values are not persisted, and Cursor remains
  unsupported for Agent Control injection.
- Worktree cleanup honors the persisted Keep, Delete, or Ask policy. Ask
  requires an explicit keep/delete input, and destructive cleanup reports one
  result per pane with `partial_failure` when removal completes but cleanup
  fails.
- Every mutation is recorded in `agent_control.mutation` with bounded source,
  target, scope, and result metadata; values, environment contents, tokens,
  and terminal output are excluded.
- Unit and protocol coverage verifies scope boundaries, stateful focus and
  ordering, tab creation, cleanup policy enforcement, and partial-failure
  reporting. Cross-tab pane moves, shell panes, and Cursor injection remain
  outside this item.

### Profiles and harness configuration record

Roadmap item 8 is implemented through the app-owned MCP mutation router:

- Global-scope `profiles.create`, `profiles.update`, `profiles.delete`, and
  `profiles.reorder` tools manage the existing ordered profile store using
  stable profile IDs.
- Profile creation seeds the selected harness defaults. Updates use keyed
  patches for CLI options and environment variables, so redacted environment
  values never need to be read back. Harness changes reset configuration to the
  new harness defaults before applying supplied patches.
- Profile option inputs are validated against the selected harness catalog,
  including boolean, single-value, and multi-value rules. App-controlled
  environment variables cannot be changed, and profile mutation results expose
  only redacted environment metadata.
- Global-scope `harnesses.set_enabled` and
  `harnesses.configure_cli_option` tools update the existing harness and CLI
  option settings. Preset values are normalized, and user-added catalog
  entries remain intact.
- Mutations persist through the existing settings files, roll back in-memory
  state when persistence fails, emit bounded `agent_control.mutation` records,
  and do not restart or alter already-running panes.
- `AgentControlMutationTests` covers lifecycle, ordering, scope rejection,
  validation, redaction, persistence-backed configuration, telemetry, preset
  normalization, and custom-option preservation.

### Status lines and notifications record

Roadmap item 9 is implemented through the existing resources and app-owned
mutation router:

- Global-scope `status_lines.update_global` replaces and persists the global
  `StatusLineConfig`. Global-scope `status_lines.update_profile` replaces a
  profile override, while `status_lines.clear_profile_override` removes only
  that override. Configurations are semantically validated before mutation,
  including built-in and custom item IDs, custom-field identity, required
  labels and commands, duplicate items, and duplicate custom fields.
- Global status-line persistence uses an atomic write and profile mutations
  roll back in-memory state when persistence fails. Mutation results return the
  applied global configuration or updated profile snapshot without exposing
  unrelated settings.
- The existing `agent-session-manager://notifications` resource remains the
  notification listing surface. Global, tab, and pane callers can use
  `notifications.acknowledge` only for visible notifications within their
  scope. Acknowledgement resolves the stable notification ID, navigates using
  the shared `AppState` path, removes the notification and delivered macOS
  notification, and preserves PR-resolution actions.
- Status-line updates and notification acknowledgement emit bounded
  `agent_control.mutation` telemetry with operation, scope, target IDs, and
  outcome metadata. Notification text, configuration payloads, secrets, and
  terminal output are excluded.
- Unit, resource, telemetry, and real-flow UI coverage verifies validation,
  persistence, profile override clearing, scope enforcement, stale targets,
  shared notification acknowledgement behavior, tool discovery, and sidebar
  acknowledgement.

### Parity, documentation, and hardening record

Roadmap item 10 is implemented as the parity and hardening closeout:

- `documentation/features/agentic-control.md` documents the app-owned MCP
  surface, policy and scope behavior, supported harness adapters, security
  guarantees, diagnostics, and Dev troubleshooting.
- `.agents/skills/feature-agentic-control/SKILL.md` and the `AGENTS.md` feature
  entry make the guide discoverable for future Agent Session Manager work.
- `agent-harness-feature-matrix.md` now audits Agent Control across harnesses,
  including the intentionally unsupported Cursor injection path.
- The tracing span catalog includes resource reads, mutations, and harness
  preparation alongside the existing lifecycle, authorization, and diagnostic
  events.
- OpenCode injection merges the app-owned MCP server into the existing inline
  MCP map without removing user-configured servers. A malformed existing MCP
  value remains an actionable configuration error.
- Streaming responses that exceed the configured limit close without emitting a
  successful HTTP end marker, so clients observe a transport failure instead of
  accepting an incomplete response as successful.

Cursor injection remains unsupported until a documented per-pane configuration
surface exists. Existing local XCTest execution may remain unavailable on hosts
where the test runner architecture does not match the generated arm64 bundle;
compatible CI or Dev build validation is required in that environment.

Validation for this closeout:

- `swift build` passed with the Agent Control changes.
- `swift test --filter AgentControlHarnessInjectionTests` compiled the test
  bundle but could not execute it because the host requested x86_64 while the
  generated bundle was arm64.
- `git diff --check` passed. Local `make lint` and SwiftLint execution were
  unavailable because `swift-format` is not installed and SwiftLint could not
  load `sourcekitdInProc.framework`; run both checks in the supported CI/Xcode
  environment.

### Feasibility spike record

The feasibility spike was research-only. Its protocol and toolchain evidence
is retained below; the implementation that follows is the separate lifecycle
phase. Temporary probes belong under an ignored temporary directory and must
remove their files, processes, and tokens before they finish.

#### Baseline captured on 2026-07-22

| Item | Observed value |
|---|---|
| Repository manifest | Swift tools 6.1, Swift 6 language mode, macOS 14 minimum |
| Host toolchain | Swift 6.4, Xcode 27.0 |
| Swift MCP SDK candidate | 0.12.1; its manifest declares Swift tools 6.1 |
| Claude Code | 2.1.216 |
| Codex | 0.144.6 |
| Cursor Agent | 2026.05.15-3f71873 |
| OpenCode | 1.18.4 |

The SDK candidate resolved and imported successfully in an isolated macOS 14
package using Swift tools 6.1 when compiled by the installed Swift 6.4
compiler. SwiftPM's tools version is a manifest compatibility floor; the
host's installed Swift 6.4 compiler remains the version used to build the
project. The app and UI-test targets now use Swift 6 language mode. Third-party
packages continue to compile in their own declared language modes, so package
updates are validated independently from the app's concurrency migration.

### MCP lifecycle and security implementation record

The lifecycle phase now has an app-owned baseline implementation:

- Swift MCP 0.12.1 and SwiftNIO are pinned in the package and Xcode project;
  the listener binds only to an ephemeral port on `127.0.0.1` at `/mcp`.
- `AgentControlService` owns start, stop, runtime-only credential registration,
  and shutdown cleanup. The app starts it before session restoration and stops
  it during application termination.
- Credentials are 256-bit random bearer tokens. Only SHA-256 hashes are kept
  in memory, credentials are never persisted, and pane or tab teardown revokes
  the associated token and MCP sessions.
- Requests require the exact loopback Host, an exact loopback Origin when an
  Origin header is supplied, a bearer token, a bounded body, an MCP session
  binding, and a per-credential concurrency limit. Responses are bounded and
  requests have a cancellation-aware timeout.
- Runtime spans cover listener start and stop, credential registration and
  revocation, timeout, stream failure, and response-limit failures. Tokens,
  request bodies, and terminal content are excluded from telemetry.
- Unit and protocol-boundary tests cover concurrency, revocation, host and
  Origin rejection, loopback binding, and unauthorized initialization.

The service now carries the configured scope with each credential and routes
authenticated resource reads through the app-owned snapshot router. Mutation
endpoints, diagnostics, subscriptions, and harness injection remain outside
this phase.

Lifecycle cleanup and security hardening now complete the phase:

- Each live MCP session retains its source pane identity, allowing pane
  credential revocation to disconnect the associated server and transport
  instead of only removing token-store mappings.
- Server shutdown disconnects every live session before closing the listener,
  while pane revocation invalidates the credential immediately and performs
  idempotent session cleanup asynchronously.
- Authorization failures, session binding and closure, stream cancellation,
  timeout, stream failure, and response-limit outcomes emit bounded telemetry.
  Authentication material, request bodies, and terminal content remain
  excluded.
- Lifecycle tests cover authenticated MCP sessions, revocation cleanup,
  authorization telemetry redaction, loopback and origin validation, request
  limits, concurrency, and unauthorized initialization.
- Request timeout task groups cancel the in-flight MCP operation, and
  cancellation is distinguished from stream failure in telemetry. The
  transport remains local-only, bearer credentials remain runtime-only, and
  all output limits remain enforced.

### Read-only resources implementation record

The read-only resource phase now exposes stable, JSON-encoded snapshots through
the app-owned MCP listener:

- Collection resources cover the workspace, profiles, harness catalogs,
  status-line configuration, and notifications.
- ID-based templates cover individual tabs, panes, profiles, and pane status
  data. Names remain display values and are never used as resource addresses.
- Pane scope sees its own pane, its parent tab, and global catalogs. Tab scope
  sees every pane in its tab and the same catalogs. Global scope sees all tabs,
  panes, profiles, harnesses, status lines, and notifications.
- Reads are resolved from live `@MainActor` `AppState` and `AppSettings` state;
  no parallel control-specific model or persistence path is introduced.
- Profile and pane environment values, bearer tokens, terminal contents,
  harness output, and other secret material are omitted or represented only by
  non-sensitive metadata.
- Resource subscriptions, writes, and harness configuration are intentionally
  not exposed yet.

Resource discovery, URI parsing, scope filtering, redaction, and an end-to-end
MCP client read are covered by `AgentControlResourceTests`. Resource reads emit
bounded `agent_control.resource.read` telemetry with source context and result
metadata, without request payloads or credentials.

The read-only resource phase is complete:

- Collection resources and stable-ID templates are covered across pane, tab, and
  global callers, including workspace, profiles, harness catalogs, status lines,
  notifications, tabs, panes, profiles, and pane status data.
- Scope enforcement remains in the resource router. Pane callers see only their
  own pane, tab callers see every pane in their tab, and global callers see the
  full workspace. Stale and cross-scope IDs return structured MCP errors.
- Profile and runtime environment values, tokens, terminal content, and harness
  output are excluded from snapshots and resource-read telemetry.
- Resource tests cover discovery, MCP-client reads, scope boundaries,
  redaction, stale IDs, notification visibility, status visibility, and
  bounded resource-read telemetry. The test bundle compiles successfully with
  the repository's Swift 6 toolchain; local XCTest execution is currently
  blocked by the host test runner loading the arm64 bundle as x86_64.

### Harness injection implementation record

Harness preparation now runs in the app-owned launch path for pane creation,
restore, restart, refresh, and continue flows. When injection is enabled, the
app registers a fresh runtime-only credential, passes the bearer through
`AGENT_SESSION_MANAGER_MCP_TOKEN`, and revokes the credential if adapter
preparation fails. The token is never placed in command arguments, persisted
session state, terminal output, or telemetry.

Claude Code receives an inline HTTP MCP configuration through `--mcp-config`,
with the bearer header referring to the runtime environment variable. OpenCode
extends its existing `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` JSON with a remote MCP server,
`oauth: false`, and the same environment reference. Codex receives ephemeral
`-c` overrides for the URL, enabled state, and bearer environment variable; no
Codex configuration file is written. Existing OpenCode safety settings and
user-provided environment values remain in the launch environment.

Cursor injection is intentionally blocked until a supported per-pane
configuration surface exists. The pane setup error explains how to recover by
disabling injection or selecting another harness. Disabled injection revokes
any prior credential and leaves the harness command and environment unchanged.

The shared preparation path emits bounded, pane-scoped
`agent_control.harness.prepare` telemetry with only harness, result, and
identity metadata. Adapter serialization and the Cursor unsupported result are
covered by `AgentControlHarnessInjectionTests`.

### Diagnostics and observability implementation record

The first diagnostics slice now exposes the four planned diagnostic resources:

- `agent-session-manager://diagnostics/summary`
- `agent-session-manager://diagnostics/traces`
- `agent-session-manager://diagnostics/invariants`
- `agent-session-manager://diagnostics/logs`

The corresponding bounded tools are `diagnostics.query_traces`,
`diagnostics.query_invariants`, `diagnostics.query_logs`, and the
Global-scope-only `debug.set_mode`. Trace and invariant readers use JSONL
metadata for identity, preserve malformed-line and source-truncation metadata,
keep legacy files separate, and apply the same pane/tab/global scope model as
other resources. Diagnostic attributes and contexts are projected through a
deny-by-default sensitive-field redactor; unified-log reads are restricted to
the app's own process and subsystem and return structured fields only.

`debug.set_mode` persists through `SettingsPersistence` and reuses the existing
`TracingService` and `InvariantReporter` configuration path. URI parsing,
metadata identity, scope filtering, repeated invariant occurrences, redaction,
and Global-only mutation behavior are covered by
`AgentControlDiagnosticsTests`; MCP resource discovery now includes the
diagnostic resources and tools.

Diagnostic reads are cooperative async operations. Trace and invariant scans
validate UUID selectors; all diagnostic scans yield while scanning, observe
task cancellation, and never return a partial result after cancellation. Query
limits remain bounded to 200 records, HTTP request-body limits use the active
server configuration, and query telemetry records source scope, result counts,
truncation, cancellation, and persistence failures without credentials or
diagnostic payloads. Existing durable files remain readable while Debug Mode is
disabled, and the unified-log path remains restricted to this process and its
subsystem.

#### Streamable HTTP result

The SDK's conformance server was started on `127.0.0.1:3001` at `/mcp`. The
[official MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
connected over Streamable HTTP and successfully completed:

- `initialize` and the initialized notification;
- `tools/list`;
- `resources/list`;
- `tools/call` for the harmless `add_numbers` fixture, returning `5`.

This validates the candidate transport and client path, including stateful
session creation, resource discovery, tool discovery, and a tool result. The
conformance fixture does not enforce the app's future per-pane bearer-token
policy, so authentication, token revocation, scope authorization, bounded
output, cancellation, and audit redaction remain gates for the lifecycle and
security phase. The MCP transport still requires loopback binding, Origin
validation, and authentication when used by the app; see the linked transport
specification above.

#### Harness injection findings

The supported configuration surfaces were confirmed from the installed CLI help
and official documentation without invoking commands that write user or
repository configuration:

| Harness | Candidate app-owned injection | Feasibility status |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Pass a temporary JSON configuration through `--mcp-config`; compare normal loading with `--strict-mcp-config`. | Supported surface confirmed; isolated end-to-end loading remains part of adapter implementation. |
| OpenCode | Add a remote MCP entry through app-owned configuration content with a URL and HTTP header. | Supported remote-server shape confirmed; merge and precedence behavior must be tested before implementation. |
| Codex | Use Streamable HTTP `url` plus `bearer_token_env_var`, supplied through documented config or launch-time overrides. | Supported surface confirmed; exact per-pane preparation must avoid `~/.codex/config.toml` and project config writes. |
| Cursor | Current documentation exposes project `.cursor/mcp.json` and global `~/.cursor/mcp.json`; the installed Agent CLI exposes no per-pane MCP-config flag. | Isolation remains unresolved. Do not write either location; this harness may remain blocked until a documented per-pane strategy exists. |

The future adapter boundary is therefore documented but not implemented:
configuration preparation receives the pane identity, endpoint, runtime token,
working directory, and existing configuration context, then returns launch
arguments, environment additions, app-owned artifacts, cleanup ownership, or an
actionable unsupported-configuration error. Tokens remain runtime-only.

#### Exit criteria for this phase

This phase is complete when the SDK and local protocol evidence above is kept in
this roadmap, each harness has a recorded supported or blocked injection path,
and no probe has modified the repository or global-user configuration. Phase 2
may proceed with transport-agnostic policy and persistence types. Phase 3 must
not start the listener until the authentication, authorization, limits,
cancellation, revocation, and telemetry gates are implemented. Harness adapter
work remains ordered Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, then Cursor.

## Testing and acceptance

- Unit-test policy resolution, ask defaults, persisted state, scope checks,
  token mapping, DTOs, ordering, option validation, cleanup choices, and
  redaction.
- Protocol-test initialize, resource/tool discovery, successful calls,
  invalid IDs, unauthorized scope, expired tokens, malformed requests,
  cancellation, and output limits.
- Protocol-test diagnostic summary, trace, invariant, and unified-log queries
  with pane/tab/global scope boundaries, time and event filters, redaction,
  truncation metadata, and Debug Mode disabled.
- Verify that only Global scope can enable or disable Debug Mode and that the
  operation persists and reconfigures existing diagnostic writers.
- Adapter-test all generated harness configuration while preserving existing
  configuration and avoiding repository pollution.
- Use a real MCP client against the isolated Dev app to create and mutate real
  tabs, panes, profiles, status-line settings, and notifications.
- Exercise the real New Pane flow for all four injection policies and verify
  the ask toggle defaults and overrides.
- Do not add fabricated state, test-only production branches, or fake
  screenshots. Run UI tests only with the approved Dev configuration.
- Add screenshot coverage for Settings and New Pane controls and inspect the
  generated artifacts before reporting visual verification.
- Load `instrument-runtime-telemetry` before implementing runtime behavior.
  Instrument server lifecycle, injection decisions, authentication,
  authorization, tool execution, failures, cancellation, and cleanup.

## Defaults and constraints

- Injection policy: `Ask (on by default)`.
- Scope: `Global`.
- Debugging reads are available at the caller's configured scope; unscoped
  global records and Debug Mode mutation require `Global` scope.
- The first debugging mutation is `debug.set_mode`; clearing, retention,
  path-management, and export operations are deferred.
- No extra Agent Session Manager confirmation for authorized MCP mutations.
- Tokens are runtime-only and never persisted or logged.
- Profile environment values are write-only or redacted in read resources.
- Policy changes affect future launches and restarts; existing harness
  processes must restart to receive changed MCP configuration.
- The app owns all setup work through Swift APIs; terminal panes receive only
  the final harness invocation.
