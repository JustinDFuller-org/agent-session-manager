## What it is

The first-launch setup wizard helps Agent Session Manager prepare the shell and agent tools you want to use. It appears once, and you can change these choices later in Settings.

## Before you start

- Use a Mac running macOS 14 or later.
- Download the latest DMG from [Download]({{ '/download/' | relative_url }}).
- Have at least one supported agent tool installed if you want to create an agent pane immediately.

## How to install it

1. Open the downloaded DMG.
2. Drag Agent Session Manager to `/Applications`.
3. Open Agent Session Manager from Applications.

## How to complete first launch

1. On the welcome screen, choose **Set Up**. Choose **Skip** if you want to keep the defaults and configure the app later.
2. On **Shell**, keep **Auto-detect** or choose a shell. Select **Other…** if you need to enter a custom shell path, then choose **Continue**.
3. On **Harnesses**, review the tools detected in your shell. Select the tools you want to use, then choose **Continue**.
4. On **Status Line**, choose which information should appear at the bottom of each pane. Choose **Save** to keep it or **Skip** to turn it off for now.
5. On **CLI Flags**, choose the options that should be available when creating a pane. Choose **Save** to keep them or **Skip** to leave the recommendations unchanged.
6. On **Profiles**, optionally create a reusable set of tool options, then choose **Finish**.

## What you should see

The wizard closes and the main window appears. If you have not created a tab yet, the empty state tells you to press ⌘T.

_Choose Set Up to walk through the first-launch choices._

![Agent Session Manager Harnesses setup screen]({{ '/assets/img/docs/onboarding-tools.png' | relative_url }})

_Select the tools you want available when creating panes._

## If it does not work

If the wizard does not detect a tool, confirm that the tool is installed and available from the selected shell. You can also enable tools later in **Settings → Harnesses**.
