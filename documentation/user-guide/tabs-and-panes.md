## What it is

A tab is a project context. A pane is one terminal session inside that tab. You can keep several tasks open in one project tab and create another tab when you switch projects.

## Why you might use it

Tabs keep projects separate, while panes let you work on multiple tasks without opening a separate terminal window for each one.

## Before you start

Create a tab for a Git repository by following the [Quickstart]({{ '/documentation/user-guide/quickstart/' | relative_url }}). To create an agent pane, make sure at least one tool is active in [Agent Tools]({{ '/documentation/user-guide/agent-tools/' | relative_url }}).

## How to use it

### Create and switch tabs

1. Choose **File → New Tab** or press ⌘T.
2. In **New Tab**, enter a project name in **Name**.
3. Choose a project directory with **Choose…**.
4. Optionally enter a starting branch in **Base Branch**.
5. Choose **Create**.
6. Select a tab in the tab bar to switch projects. You can also press ⌘1 through ⌘9 to switch to a tab by position.

### Create a pane

1. Choose **File → New Pane in Current Tab** or press ⌘P.
2. In **New Pane**, select a tool in **Harness**.
3. Enter a name, branch, or existing worktree in **Session, branch, or worktree**.
4. Review any **CLI Options** or **Environment Variables**.
5. Choose **Create Pane**.

### Open a shell in a pane's working directory

1. Open the pane's context menu.
2. Choose **Open Shell Here**.

The new shell pane uses the same working directory as the pane you selected.

### Refresh a pane

To restart an agent pane with a fresh environment, open its context menu and choose **Refresh Pane…**, or press ⌘R when it is the active pane. Choose **Refresh and Continue** to restart with the same settings and `--continue`. Choose **Refresh with New Settings…** to change the CLI options before restarting. This action is not available for plain shell panes.

### Close a pane or tab

Choose the close button in a pane header or press ⌘W to close the active pane. To close the active tab, press ⌘K or use **File → Close Tab**.

If the pane uses a working copy managed by Agent Session Manager, closing it may show cleanup choices. See [Worktree Cleanup]({{ '/documentation/user-guide/worktree-cleanup/' | relative_url }}).

## What you should see

The tab bar remains at the top of the window, and panes appear below it in a grid. Adding panes changes the grid layout while keeping each terminal session visible.

### Session names

For Claude Code panes, **Auto Session Name** can pass the tab and pane names to Claude so the session is easier to find when you resume it. Open **Settings → Panes → Terminal** to enable or disable it. If you add a manual **Session Name** option in **Settings → Harnesses → CLI Options**, the manual value takes precedence.

_Each pane has its own header, terminal area, and status line._

## If it does not work

- If **Create** is disabled in **New Tab**, provide both a name and a directory.
- If **Create Pane** is unavailable, activate at least one tool in **Settings → Harnesses**.
- If the session field reports an invalid or duplicate name, enter a valid name, branch ref, or existing worktree that is not already open in the tab.
